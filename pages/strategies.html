<h2>Welcome to Survival</h2>

<p>If you are going to survive I would suggest learning more than hiding and hoping, you need to know how to fight, run, and use whatever you have around you to your advantage. You need to learn how to survive as well as hide. If you want to survive good luck if you don't good riddance.</p>
