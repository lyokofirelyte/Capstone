		<h2 id="indexH1">Welcome to Survival</h2>
			<p>If you are going to survive I would suggest learning more than hiding and hoping, you need to know how to fight, run, and use whatever you have around you to your advantage. You need to learn how to survive as well as hide. Here are some basic and advanced tips that will help with your survival. If you want to learn how to survive good luck if you don't good riddance.

	<h2 id="indexH1">Shelter</h2>
		<p>One of the first things that you need to survive is shelter. You will have to fortify the location you are staying in. One of the first things you could do would be to board up the doors and windows so nothing can get inside of the place you are staying.You will also need to put up perimeter defenses. Some of the things that could use are pit traps and sharpened branches to place around the location. </p>
